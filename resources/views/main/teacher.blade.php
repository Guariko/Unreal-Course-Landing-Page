        <p>Hello my friend, this is Cris Smykel, I am the Founder of Guariko.</p>

        <p>First I want you to know that I am very happy to share with you
            all my knowledge acquired in 3D over 20 years.</p>

        <p>I started using Unreal a few years ago and I'm more and more
            impressed with this fantastic tool, and I can tell you,
            this Unreal Engine 5 course for Guariko will blow your mind! He's very special.</p>

        <p>
            There are more than 90 classes where I will hold you by the hand and take you to the extraordinary!
            On this journey I will prove to you that knowing 3D is not enough!
            You will become an expert in the Unreal Engine for Archviz and be a
            prominent member of this futuristic,
            promising and well-paying market that is 3D and prepare for the Metaverse.</p>

        <p>We know that in this Metaverse market it won't be enough to just know 3D,
            you'll need to show that you really know what you're doing!
            And one of the best ways to deliver this is in the experience
            you bring to the delivery of your projects.</p>

        <p>I guarantee you, if you do everything that I will teach you in this course,
            my knowledge will be complementary to yours and
            your projects will be highlighted in an extraordinary way!</p>

        <p>Welcome, see you there in the student group!</p>
